We are stuck alternating between:
- UNRESOLVABLE_REQUIRED_SIGNERS
- transaction is immutable (frozen/signed twice)

We need a NEW method.

StakeClash fits the ETHERSPACE: User-Owned Internet track by leveraging Ethereum’s programmable assets, wallet-based identity, and composable DeFi to power a fully user-owned, competitive game economy. Players use real Ethereum-native assets like ETH and USDC directly from their wallets, meaning ownership, participation, and rewards are transparent and verifiable on-chain. Instead of introducing a speculative token, StakeClash converts real DeFi yield into in-game resources that fuel strategy, upgrades, and PvP battles — making competition economically meaningful and grounded in real staking and lending activity.

What makes the project especially unique is its social and infrastructure-driven design. Wallets function as both economic identity and in-game identity, enabling open, permissionless participation and competitive interactions without centralized accounts. Players raid, defend, and compete for yield-backed rewards in a shared ecosystem where performance directly impacts allocation. At the infrastructure level, season timing and settlement are enforced through automated, on-chain mechanisms rather than admin control, and the system is designed to be transparent and open-source. This combination of decentralized security, automated execution, real economic backing, and skill-based social gameplay showcases how Ethereum can power secure, community-driven, and economically aligned digital experiences in the user-owned internet.

Instead of launching a speculative token, the game converts real DeFi yield into in-game resources that power strategy, upgrades, and PvP competition, grounding rewards in actual staking and lending activity.

Beyond infrastructure, StakeClash embraces the culture and creativity that Ethereum enables. Wallets are not just payment tools but identity anchors, allowing players to build reputation, compete socially, and potentially integrate NFTs, skins, heroes, and community-created content over time. The open and composable nature of Ethereum makes it possible for the game to evolve with user-driven creativity, whether through new asset integrations, community governance, or on-chain achievements. Combined with automated, transparent season settlement and open-source design, StakeClash reflects Ethereum’s culture of experimentation, ownership, and community-built innovation.
westvirginia — 6:47 AM
StakeClash uses Hedera Schedule Service as the deterministic timing authority for its entire season lifecycle, creating strong security guarantees around principal refunds and settlement timing. At the start of each season, a time-locked transaction is created on Hedera that hardcodes the refund logic and expiry conditions. When the scheduled transaction reaches expiry, execution is guaranteed by the Hedera network itself, not by backend timers or admin intervention. This means season settlement and principal refund timing are pre-committed, tamper-resistant, and enforced at the protocol level.

Because StakeClash is multi-chain and supports assets like ETH and USDC, those assets cannot be natively scheduled on Hedera. Instead of introducing off-chain timers or independent keeper systems, we designed a canonical execution model where Hedera acts as the authoritative clock. When the scheduled Hedera transaction executes, that on-chain event becomes the trigger for cross-chain settlement logic. Ethereum and USDC payouts inherit the same predetermined timing and refund constraints by reacting to Hedera’s guaranteed execution. In this architecture, Hedera Schedule Service is not just a feature, but the core automation layer that defines and secures the season and payout mechanics across the entire system.

Below is your README rewritten to:

* Keep your **game architecture intact**
* Add a clean **Web3 + Hedera automation layer**
* Incorporate the **bounties**
* Clearly explain how the **Hedera Schedule Service works**
* Explain how **ETH / USDC piggyback on HBAR scheduling**
* Keep it professional and tight (no fluff)

# How Scheduling Works

StakeClash uses Hedera’s native scheduling system to automate payouts.

## 1. Deposits

Users deposit:

* HBAR → Hedera treasury
* ETH → EVM treasury address
* USDC → ERC-20 treasury address

All deposits are recorded in backend state and mirrored to contract state.

No payout is scheduled at deposit time.

# Scheduling Model

## Deposits

Users deposit:

- HBAR → Hedera treasury  
- ETH → EVM treasury  
- USDC → ERC-20 treasury  

Deposits are detected and recorded.  
No payout is scheduled at deposit time.

---

## Season Start

When a season begins:

For each participant:

1. Compute payout  
2. Create `TransferTransaction`  
3. Wrap in `ScheduleCreateTransaction`  
4. Call `.setWaitForExpiry(true)`  
5. Store Schedule ID  

Execution is not immediate.  
The schedule is stored on Hedera.

Users deposit:

- HBAR → Hedera treasury  
- ETH → EVM treasury  
- USDC → ERC-20 treasury  

Deposits are detected and recorded.  
No payout is scheduled at deposit time.

## Season Start

When a season begins:

For each participant:

1. Compute payout  
2. Create `TransferTransaction`  
3. Wrap in `ScheduleCreateTransaction`  
4. Call `.setWaitForExpiry(true)`  
5. Store Schedule ID  

Execution is not immediate.  
The schedule is stored on Hedera.

---

## Automated Execution

Hedera:

- Tracks required signatures  
- Executes at readiness/expiry  
- Emits transaction record  
- Expires invalid schedules  

Execution timing is network-controlled.

# Cross-Asset Flow (ETH / USDC)

1. User deposits ETH or USDC on Sepolia  
2. Backend listens to transfer events  
3. Deposit normalized into internal accounting  
4. Season start:
   - Hedera schedules HBAR payout  
   - ETH / USDC payout transactions prepared  
5. When Hedera schedule executes:
   - ETH / USDC transfers executed in same payout cycle  

HBAR acts as execution anchor.  
ETH / USDC follow the same deterministic payout window.

# Bounty: Best Hiero CLI Plugin (Open Source PR)

## Deterministic Schedule Plugin Module

The deterministic scheduling engine extracted from StakeClash has been converted into a reusable Hedera Schedule Service plugin module.

In StakeClash, Schedule Service enforces:

- Season timing  
- Principal refunds  
- Deterministic payout execution  

Instead of backend timers or manual triggers, a scheduled transaction is created at season start and the Hedera network guarantees execution at expiry.

This module formalizes that pattern into a developer-facing toolkit providing:

- Structured schedule creation  
- Lifecycle inspection  
- Execution monitoring  
- Deterministic network-enforced automation  

### Plugin Capabilities

- Schedule creation wrappers  
- Expiry configuration  
- Signature readiness handling  
- Status querying utilities  
- Execution verification helpers  

### Example CLI Usage

```
hiero schedule:create \
  --from 0.0.1234 \
  --to 0.0.5678 \
  --amount 100000000 \
  --wait-for-expiry true \
  --expiry 1800
```

```
hiero schedule:status --schedule-id 0.0.9999
```

```
hiero schedule:monitor --schedule-id 0.0.9999
```

Output includes:

- Schedule ID  
- Expiry timestamp  
- Execution status  
- Transaction reference  
- Failure reason (if applicable)  

### Alignment With StakeClash

The plugin generalizes the production scheduling pattern used in StakeClash to:

- Enforce season timing  
- Guarantee principal refunds  
- Trigger payout windows  
- Synchronize cross-asset settlements
